# Random Quote Machine

This program is a random quote generator that displays a new quote and its author each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. 
The user can also tweet the current quote by clicking on the "Tweet Quote" button. The program is built using a frontend framework such as React, 
and it fulfills a set of user stories that include displaying the quote and author in specific HTML elements, centering the layout, 
and using a clean and minimalist design with a zen-inspired background. 
The program uses the Axios library to fetch the quotes from an API or external data source.
